### 🚀 Projects
Here are some things I’ve built recently:

- 🧠 [**Student Dropout Prediction Data Analysis using Machine Learning**](https://github.com/abhaykamath/dropout-predictor)  
  ML + data visualization to predict dropouts in higher education.

- 🍽️ [**Typing Speed Tester**](https://github.com/abhaykamath/qr-menu)  
  A site to test and improve your typing speed. I plan on expanding this into a full service later.

- 💧 [**Smart Water Bottle**](https://github.com/abhaykamath/smart-bottle)  
  IoT project that reminds users to hydrate using alarms.
